      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a rising senior at Ardrey Kell High School in North Carolina. I have a passion for both biology and computer science which is quite intriguing and leads me to many opportunities. I believe that it is curiosity and persistence that brings about meaningful change. My values are rooted in a desire to make a positive impact, whether through educating others or pushing the boundaries of what science and technology can achieve.</p>
      <p>My journey in STEM has been shaped by a diverse range of experiences that span both biology and computer science. From conducting research on biophilic design in urban neighborhoods to earning recognition in geospatial technology competitions, I've cultivated a skill set that blends analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. Volunteering at Idea Lab Kids and Discovery Place Science has further enriched my understanding of how to engage others in the wonders of science, fueling my ambition to pursue a career at the intersection of these fields.</p>
